; Work in progress.
; This file will cross-assemble an original version of the "Improved"
; ZX81 ROM.  The file can be modified to change the behaviour of the ROM
; when used in emulators although there is no spare space available.
;
; The documentation is incomplete and if you can find a copy
; of "The Complete Spectrum ROM Disassembly" then many routines
; such as POINTERS and most of the mathematical routines are
; similar and often identical.
;
; I've used the labels from the above book in this file and also
; some from the more elusive Complete ZX81 ROM Disassembly
; by the same publishers, Melbourne House.

; THE <b><font color=3D"#333388">'INTERRUPT'</font></b> RESTART
; -----------------------
;   The Mode 1 Interrupt routine is concerned solely with generating the ce=
ntral
;   television picture.
;   On the ZX81 interrupts are enabled only during the interrupt routine,=
=20
;   although the interrupt=20
;   This Interrupt Service Routine automatically disables interrupts at the=
=20
;   outset and the last interrupt in a cascade exits before the interrupts =
are
;   enabled.
;   There is no DI instruction in the ZX81 ROM.
;   An maskable interrupt is triggered when bit 6 of the Z80's Refresh regi=
ster
;   changes from set to reset.
;   The Z80 will always be executing a HALT (NEWLINE) when the interrupt oc=
curs.
;   A HALT instruction repeatedly executes NOPS but the seven lower bits
;   of the Refresh register are incremented each time as they are when any=
=20
;   simple instruction is executed. (The lower 7 bits are incremented twice=
 for
;   a prefixed instruction)
;   This is controlled by the Sinclair Computer Logic Chip - manufactured f=
rom=20
;   a Ferranti Uncommitted Logic Array.
;
;   When a Mode 1 Interrupt occurs the Program Counter, which is the addres=
s in
;   the upper echo display following the NEWLINE/HALT instruction, goes on =
the=20
;   machine stack.  193 interrupts are required to generate the last part o=
f
;   the 56th border line and then the 192 lines of the central TV picture a=
nd,=20
;   although each interrupt interrupts the previous one, there are no stack=
=20
;   problems as the 'return address' is discarded each time.
;
;   The scan line counter in C counts down from 8 to 1 within the generatio=
n of
;   each text line. For the first interrupt in a cascade the initial value =
of=20
;   C is set to 1 for the last border line.
;   Timing is of the utmost importance as the RH border, horizontal retrace
;   and LH border are mostly generated in the 58 clock cycles this routine=

; e.g. 2.3E4 is 23000.
; This subroutine evaluates xEm where m is a positive or negative integer.
; At a simple level x is multiplied by ten for every unit of m.
; If the decimal exponent m is negative then x is divided by ten for each u=
nit.
; A short-cut is taken if the exponent is greater than seven and in this
; case the exponent is reduced by seven and the value is multiplied or divi=

; <font color=3D"#9900FF">Note.</font> for the ZX Spectrum an even cleverer=
 method was adopted which involved
; shifting the bits out of the exponent so the result was achieved with six
; shifts at most. The routine below had to be completely re-written mostly
; in Z80 machine code.
; Although no longer operable, the calculator literal was retained for old
; times sake, the routine being invoked directly from a machine code CALL.
;
; On entry in the ZX81, m, the exponent, is the 'last value', and the
; floating-point decimal mantissa is beneath it.

; THE <b><font color=3D"#333388">'NATURAL LOGARITHM'</font></b> FUNCTION
; --------------------------------
; <font color=3D"#339933">(offset $22: 'ln')</font>
;   Like the ZX81 itself, 'natural' logarithms came from Scotland.
;   They were devised in 1614 by well-traveled Scotsman John Napier who not=
ed
;   "Nothing doth more molest and hinder calculators than the multiplicatio=
ns,
;    divisions, square and cubical extractions of great numbers".
;
;   Napier's logarithms enabled the above operations to be accomplished by=
=20
;   simple addition and subtraction simplifying the navigational and=20
;   astronomical calculations which beset his age.
;   Napier's logarithms were quickly overtaken by logarithms to the base 10
;   devised, in conjunction with Napier, by Henry Briggs a Cambridge-educat=
ed=20
;   professor of Geometry at Oxford University. These simplified the layout
;   of the tables enabling humans to easily scale calculations.
;
;   It is only recently with the introduction of pocket calculators and
;   computers like the ZX81 that natural logarithms are once more at the fo=
re,
;   although some computers retain logarithms to the base ten.
;   'Natural' logarithms are powers to the base 'e', which like 'pi' is a=
=20
;   naturally occurring number in branches of mathematics.
;   Like 'pi' also, 'e' is an irrational number and starts 2.718281828...
;
;   The tabular use of logarithms was that to multiply two numbers one look=
ed
;   up their two logarithms in the tables, added them together and then loo=
ked=20
;   for the result in a table of antilogarithms to give the desired product=
.
;
;   The EXP function is the BASIC equivalent of a calculator's 'antiln' fun=
ction=20
;   and by picking any two numbers, 1.72 and 6.89 say,
;     10 PRINT EXP ( LN 1.72 + LN 6.89 )=20
;   will give just the same result as
;     20 PRINT 1.72 * 6.89.
;   Division is accomplished by subtracting the two logs.
;
;   Napier also mentioned "square and cubicle extractions".=20
;   To raise a number to the power 3, find its 'ln', multiply by 3 and find=
 the=20
;   'antiln'.  e.g. PRINT EXP( LN 4 * 3 )  gives 64.
;   Similarly to find the n'th root divide the logarithm by 'n'.
;   The ZX81 ROM used PRINT EXP ( LN 9 / 2 ) to find the square root of the=
=20
;   number 9. The Napieran square root function is just a special case of=
=20
;   the 'to_power' function. A cube root or indeed any root/power would be =
just
;   as simple.

;   First test that the argument to LN is a positive, non-zero number.

; THE <b><font color=3D"#333388">'TRIGONOMETRIC'</font></b> FUNCTIONS
; -----------------------------
;   Trigonometry is rocket science. It is also used by carpenters and pyram=
id
;   builders.=20
;   Some uses can be quite abstract but the principles can be seen in simpl=
e
;   right-angled triangles. Triangles have some special properties -
;
;   1) The sum of the three angles is always PI radians (180 degrees).
;      Very helpful if you know two angles and wish to find the third.
;   2) In any right-angled triangle the sum of the squares of the two short=
er
;      sides is equal to the square of the longest side opposite the right-=
angle.
;      Very useful if you know the length of two sides and wish to know the
;      length of the third side.
;   3) Functions sine, cosine and tangent enable one to calculate the lengt=
h=20
;      of an unknown side when the length of one other side and an angle is=
=20
;      known.
;   4) Functions arcsin, arccosine and arctan enable one to calculate an un=
known
;      angle when the length of two of the sides is known.
