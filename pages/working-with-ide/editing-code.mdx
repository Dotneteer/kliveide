# Editing code

KliveIDE leverages Monaco editor (the one in Visual Studio Code) as its code editor, so search for VS Code documentation about basic usage patterns. While the editor in Klive uses the same experience as in VS Code, it does not have the tools that language servers and VS Code extensions provide.

You can set some preferences with the menu items within the **View | Editor Options** menu.

These settings are saved to your project and the Klive settings file. When you load a project, the project settings override the previous Klive settings.
</Callout>

These are the preferences you can set:

- **Font size**: The relative font size of the editor.
- **Enable AutoComplete**. The editor provides AutoComplete patterns from samples you typed in earlier. I suggest you keep this option turned off. *In the future, Klive may include its smart AutoComplete functionality, which is aware of the Z80 assembly syntax.*
- **Enable Selection Highlight**. This option highlights all other occurrences of the selected text in the editor.
- **Enable Occurrences Highlight**. This option highlights all other occurrences of the symbol (e.g., variable or function name) under the cursor without needing to select it.
- **Detect Indentation**. Use this option to automatically set (and override) the **Tab Size** and **Insert Spaces instead of Tabs** options based on the file's content (i.e., it detects indentation style from the text).
- **Insert Spaces instead of Tabs**. This option controls whether pressing the Tab key inserts actual spaces or a tab character.
- **Render Whitespaces**. This option controls whether and how whitespace characters (spaces, tabs) are visibly rendered in the editor.
- **Tab Size**. The tabulator size to use with the editor.
