# The Watch View

With this view, you can observe values of symbols while developing and debugging. You can find this view in the Debug activity tab with the Watch header.

<ClickableImage src="/images/working-with-ide/watch-panel.png" width={351} />

Each row represents a watch item with the following information:
- An icon showing the watch value category
  - numeric (direct or indirect)
  - string
  - warning (when unresolved)
- The symbol name (uppercased)
- The current value (formatted)

When a watch cannot be evaluated yet (for example, compiled symbols or memory content are unavailable), it displays “`<unknown>`”. If the symbol is not found in the current compiled output, the value shows “`<not found>`”.

> **Note:** To ensure symbol addresses are up to date, rebuild your project after making code changes. Unresolved symbols will display as “`<not found>`”.

## Adding and Removing Watch Items

You manage watches through interactive commands:

- Add a watch

  ```
  w-add [>]<symbol>[:<type>[:<length>]]
  ```

  `>`: optional; when present, uses the symbol's direct value rather than reading from memory

  `<type>`:
  - b: 8-bit value
  - w: 16-bit little-endian value
  - -w: 16-bit big-endian value
  - l: 32-bit little-endian value
  - -l: 32-bit big-endian value
  - f: flag (true/false)
  - a: byte array (length required; default: 8 when omitted)
  - s: string (length required; default: 8 when omitted)

- Remove a watch

  ```
  w-del <symbol>
  ```

- List watches

  ```
  w-list
  ```

- Remove all watches

  ```
  w-ea
  ```

In addition to commands, you can remove a watch directly in the Watch view by right‑clicking its icon.

Examples:
- `w-add playerScore`
- `w-add playerScore:w`
- `w-add >playerAddress:w`
- `w-add buffer:a:32`
- `w-add text:s:16`

## Understanding Value Formatting

The Watch panel formats values based on the symbol’s type and whether the watch is direct or memory-based.

- Direct integer values (uses '>')
  - Always shown as 16-bit number: $HHHH (D)
  - Example: $12AB (4779)

- Memory-based integer values (no '>')
  - The symbol’s integer value is treated as a 16-bit address
  - The panel reads memory according to the selected type and endianness
  - Displayed as $HH (D), $HHHH (D), or $HHHHHHHH (D) for 8/16/32-bit types

- Strings (type: s)
  - Reads up to `<length>` bytes, stops at NUL (0x00)
  - Non-printable bytes are shown as '.'
  - Displayed quoted: "..."

- Arrays (type: a)
  - Displays up to the first 16 bytes as hex pairs separated by spaces
  - If longer than 16 bytes, shows a suffix like:  … (+N)

- Flags (type: f)
  - Shown as true or false (non-zero => true)

> **Note**: When you move the mouse over the watch item's icon, the appearing tooltip will show the symbol's display type.

## Typical Workflows

- Track a direct counter/constant
  - w-add >frameCounter
  - Shows as a 16-bit value regardless of the type

- Monitor a pointer and the data it refers to
  - w-add ptr:w   # watch shows the 16-bit value at address ptr (little-endian)
  - w-add textPtr:s:32   # shows a printable string at the location pointed by textPtr

- Inspect a small memory block
  - w-add buffer:a:16

## Tips

- If you frequently work with strings or arrays and omit length, the default is 8.
- Use w-list to verify your watch specifications and types.
- Rebuild your project to update symbol addresses when you change code; unresolved symbols will display as “`<not found>`”.
