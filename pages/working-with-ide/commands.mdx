# Using IDE Commands

The IDE provides you access to several command functions. To reach them, press `F1` (or `Command+Shift+P` on Mac) and type "ide" to list all IDE commands. For example, this command lists all break points you set in your code files:

In many cases, you can access these commands with menu items, toolbar buttons, or keyboard shortcuts.
