# Exporting Code

When your code is ready to be tested on actual hardware or with another emulator, you can export it with the **Build | Export code** menu command. This command pops up a dialog:

Before exporting the code, you can specify several parameters:
- **Export format**. You can select one of these file formats from the dropdown to export your code:
  - **`TAP format`: Standard `.tap` file format
  - **`TZX format`: Standard `.tzx` file format
  - **`Intel HEX format`: Standard text file format you can use with classic tools (e.g., EPROM burners).
- **Export folder**. An optional folder to save the exported file. If you do not specify this folder, the IDE will save the exported file into the `KliveExports` folder under your home directory.
- **Export file name**. The filename for the export is mandatory. If you do not specify a file name extension, Klive will add it according to the selected export format.
- **Program name**. The name to add to the tape file header. If you leave it empty, the export infers the program name from the export file name.
- **Startup border**. You can specify a color name for the border during the load operation (while loading the app's code files).
- **Screen file**. You can optionally add a screen file for your code. The IDE accepts these formats:
  - A `.tap` or `.tzx` file that is created when saving a screen (with the `SAVE "<name>" SCREEN$` command)
  - A standard 6912 bytes long `.scr` file with the raw screen contents.
  - A standard 7040 bytes long `.scr` file with 128 bytes +3DOS header and the raw screen contents. Klive does not test the +3DOS header; it just uses the raw screen bytes.
- **Create startup block**. If you check this option, the export creates a startup loader for your code; otherwise, it creates a simple file you can load as a port of your custom loader. If this option is checked, the other options are enabled to customize the startup loader.
- **Add CLEAR**. Adds a `CLEAR` statement to the loader.
- **Add PAUSE 0**. Adds a PAUSE 0 statement to the loader. When your code has been completely loaded, it waits for a keypress before running.
- **Use a single code block**. If this option is checked, your separate code segments (according to their `ORG` directives) are merged in a single block, gaps filled with zeros. Otherwise, the export creates a separate code file for each code block.
