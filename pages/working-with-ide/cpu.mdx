# The CPU View

You can find this view in the Debug activity tag with the **Z80 CPU** header:

<Image src={cpuView} alt="CPU view" width={256} style={{marginTop: 24}} />

When you hover the mouse over the information items, they display a tooltip with numbers in multiple radixes (whenever that has a meaning).

You can read this information in this panel:
- **Z80 registers**: All the standard Z80 registers (moving the mouse over the values will display LSB and MSB separately). The `WZ` is an internal Z80 register, often called `MEMPTR`.
- **`LMR`**: Last value read from memory
- **`LMW`**: Last value written to memory
- **`IRV`**: Last value read from an I/O port
- **`IWV`**: Last value written to an I/O port
- **`IM`**: Current interrupt mode
- **`SNZ`**: Is the CPU in snoozed mode (Cambridge Z88 uses this CPU mode)
- **`IFF1`**:  Interrupt flip-flop #1
- **`IFF2`**:  Interrupt flip-flop #2
- **`INT`**: Is the `INT` signal active?
- **`HLT`**: Is the CPU halted?
- **`CLK`**: The current clock count since the last machine start
- **`TSP`**: T-states elapsed since the last pause. You can use this value to check the number of T-states used between two pauses.
