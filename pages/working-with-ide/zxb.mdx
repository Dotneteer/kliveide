# ZXBASIC Integration

Klive IDE supports ZXBASIC out-of-the-box. After setting up ZXBASIC integration, you can use Klive IDE to edit and run ZXBASIC programs.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
The current version of ZXBASIC does not provide debug information, so source code debugging is not available with the IDE yet.
</Callout>

As Klive IDE does not know where to find the ZXBASIC compiler on your machine, you must set it up before using it.

## Setting up ZXBASIC

You need to download and install [ZXBASIC](https://zxbasic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/archive/). Note the installation folder; you will need it to set up the integration with Klive.

The IDE provides a command, `zxb-reset` (or shorter, `zxbr`), to connect Klive with ZXBASIC. You can issue this command from the Command window:

<Image src={zxbReset} alt="ZxbReset" width="770" height="210" style={{marginTop: 24}} />

The command expects one to three parameters:
- The path to the ZXBASIC compiler (required)
- The path to access the Python interpreter (optional; you may need it on Mac and Linux)
- The machine code origin address (optional, `$8000`, if omitted)

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
The ZXBASIC compiler is a Python script, so you need to have Python installed on your machine. On Windows, the IDE can find the Python interpreter automatically. On Mac and Linux, you must provide the path to the Python interpreter.
</Callout>

You can learn more about how [settings](./ide-settings) are stored.
</Callout>

### Windows Integration

Windows 10 and 11 usually install Python with the OS. If not, you can install Python from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). ZXBASIC requires Python 3.10 or higher. The installer adds its folder to the `PATH` environment variable, so you can use `zxb-reset` with a single command parameter:

```text
zxb-reset <full path to zxbc.exe>
```

When you define the path, you should provide the reference for the `zxbc.exe` file within the folder. For example, if you installed ZXBASIC into the `C:\Users\joe\zxbasic` folder, use this command:

```text
zxb-reset C:\Users\joe\zxbasic\zxbc.exe
```

When you have a space anywhere in the path, wrap the path into double quotes:

```text
zxb-reset "C:\My folder with spaces\zxbasic\zxbc.exe"
```

### MacOS Integration

On MacOS, use the `zxb-reset` command with a full path to the `zxbc.py` file, like in this example:

```text
zxb-reset /Users/joe/zxbasic/zxbc.py
```

Most of the time, you must also specify the Python interpreter path:

```text
zxb-reset /Users/joe/zxbasic/zxbc.py /opt/homebrew/bin
```

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
You can find the path of the Python installation with the `which python3` command. Do not forget that the last segment is the `python3` executable; you should omit it from the path specification.
</Callout>

### Linux Integration

*Thanks to [@pennyarcade](https://github.com/pennyarcade) for providing the following description.*

Integration works the same on Linux as on Mac OS since the latter is derived from Linux.

- Download the appropriate ZXBasic for your architecture ARM/X86.
- It comes with a packaged Python runtime and shell scripts for easy usage.
- You can use the platform-independent package. In this case, you must provide the path to your system's Python interpreter.
- Extract the content to any folder of your choice.
- Use the `zxb-reset` command as you would do on MacOS.

## Using ZXBASIC

Klive IDE considers files with `.zxbas` extension to be ZXBASIC source files. When you open such a file in the code editor (select a file in Explorer), the IDE applies the syntax highlighting of ZXBASIC.

When you create a new project, by default, the `code/code.kz80.asm` file is the build root. However, when you right-click the `code/program.zxbas` file and use the **Promote build root** command, this file becomes the new build root. From now on, you can use the commands in the document tab toolbar when the `program.zxbas` file is open.

<Image src={zxbActions} alt="ZxbasActions" width="725" height="224" style={{marginTop: 24}} />

You can use the toolbar buttons to compile, inject, start, or debug the code as described in [this article ](../getting-started/creating-project#build-root-commands).

When you run the ZXBASIC code in the default Klive project template, you can see the result in the Emulator window:
