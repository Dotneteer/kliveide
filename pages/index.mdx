# Introduction to Klive IDE

**Klive IDE is a retro computer emulator and Integrated Development Environment running on Mac and Windows.**

Klive offers not only the emulators but also debugging views, a multi-pane code editor, interactive commands, and other tools to create your Z80 Assembly and ZX BASIC (Boriel's Basic) programs.

Klive IDE supports dual monitor mode to place the Emulator and IDE on different monitors while working with code.

## Supported Emulators

Klive IDE intends to support retro computers with the Z80 family of CPUs. Klive supports these emulators:

- **ZX Spectrum 48K**
- **ZX Spectrum 128K**
- **ZX Spectrum +2E/+3E** (*in progress*)
- ZX 80/81 (*in the future*)
- Cambridge Z88 (*in the future*)
- ZX Spectrum Next (*in the future*)

## Emulator Features

The emulator can run the selected machine with or without debugging. These modes can be changed without restarting the running machine:

- Starting, pausing, continuing to run
- Start or continue in debug mode
- Setting up breakpoints, step-in, step-over, step-out modes

To examine the state of the emulator, Klive offers several views:

- Full CPU view
- Full ULA view
- Memory view with live refresh
- Disassembly view with execution point tracking
- Monitoring system variable values
- Displaying (and exporting) the current BASIC listing

You can quickly load and play programs (games) from files:

- Loading tape files (`.tap` and `.tzx`)
- Fast load
- Loading from disk files (`.dsk`) with ZX Spectrum +3E
- Writing and formatting disk (`.dsk`) files (*in progress*)

Other emulator features:

- Multiplying CPU clock speed (1-24 multiplier)
- Setting up the sound level, muting and unmuting sound

Planned features (*in the future*):

- Using custom machine ROMs
- Memory read/write breakpoints
- I/O read/write breakpoints
- Breakpoints with hit count conditions
