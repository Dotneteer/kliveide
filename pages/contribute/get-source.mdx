# Get the Source Code

If you want to contribute to Klive, you should get the source code with these steps:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download (use the LTS version)
2. We recommend using Visual Studio Code. Nonetheless, you can work with your preferred development tool.
3. Fork the Klive GitHub repository (https://github.com/Dotneteer/kliveide) and clone your fork with `git clone`.
4. Execute `npm install`.
5. After these steps, Klive should start with `npm run dev`.

When your contribution is ready to submit, create a GitHub Pull Request from your fork's branch to Klive's `master` branch. The team will review it and decide how to merge it.
