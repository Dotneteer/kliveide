# Get the Source Code

If you want to contribute to Klive, you should get the source code with these steps:
1. Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download (use the LTS version)
2. I'm using Visual Studio Code and suggest you do, too. Nonetheless, you can work with your preferred development tool.
3. Fork the Klive GitHub repository (https://github.com/Dotneteer/kliveide) and clone your fork with `git clone`.
4. Execute `npm install`.
5. After these steps, Klive should start with `npm run dev`.

When your contribution is ready to submit, create a GitHub Pull Request from your fork's branch to Klive's `master` branch. I will review it and decide how to merge it.
