# Improve the Documentation

Though I try to make high-quality documentation, you may find typos, grammar issues, clumsy explanations, out-of-date information, and other problems.

You can help me by fixing these issues or submitting new content.

Klive generates its documentation using [Nextra](https://nextra.site/). In this article, I help you contribute to improving documentation. 

Follow the steps to [get the source code](./get-source).

## Running the Documentation Site Locally

Start the documentation site locally on your development machine with the `npm run doc:dev` command, then visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

This site uses hot module reloading (HMR), so as you modify the documentation, updates are displayed live in your browser. When you have completed all modifications, create a GitHub Pull Request from your working branch to Klive's `master` branch to let me review and merge your changes.

## Documentation Structure

You can find these documentation-related folders within the project's root:
- **`pages`**: The source documentation files using Nextra and the `.mdx` (extended markdown) format. Documentation lives in `.mdx` files. The content of this folder represents the hierarchy of the documentation. Each folder describes its content in a `_meta.ts` file (you'll understand them; they map the individual files with the table of contents).
- **`public/images`**: The image resources of the documentation pages (organized hierarchically). 
The project contains some other Nextra-related files; please do not touch them. If you have to do so, please add some comments to your submitted PR so that I can understand your intention.

## Common Documentation Tasks

### Adding a New Page

1. Create a new `.mdx` page in the appropriate folder. Use a short name representing the contents you intend to describe.
2. Optionally, you can create a new folder and add documentation files there.
3. Ensure you update the `_meta.ts` file in the new article folder with a suitable title. Place the new article in the location where it fits the best among the already existing articles.

You can consider existing articles as examples.

### Adding images

You can add images following these steps:

1. Add the following line to the top of the `.mdx` file:
```js
import Image from 'next/image'
```

2. Copy the image to add into the right folder within `public/images` (under the project's root folder).
Import the image from that folder into your `.mdx` file like in this sample:

```js
import memView from '../../public/images/working-with-ide/mem-view.png'
```

3. Use the `<Image>` tag to place your image in an article:

```xml
<Image src={memView} alt="Memory view" width={512} style={{marginTop: 24}} />
```

If you want to change the default 24px margin, update the `style` attribute accordingly. To set the image's display dimensions, use the `width` or `height` (or both) attributes.
