# Scientific Notation Test

Testing various real number formats:

```z80-klive
; Scientific notation without decimal point
value1 = 3e+4        ; Should be highlighted as real number
value2 = 2e-5        ; Should be highlighted as real number
value3 = 1E+10       ; Should be highlighted as real number
value4 = 5E-3        ; Should be highlighted as real number

; Scientific notation with decimal point
value5 = 3.14e+2     ; Should be highlighted as real number
value6 = 2.5e-1      ; Should be highlighted as real number
value7 = 1.0E+5      ; Should be highlighted as real number

; Regular decimal numbers
value8 = 3.14        ; Should be highlighted as real number
value9 = 0.5         ; Should be highlighted as real number
value10 = 42.0       ; Should be highlighted as real number

; Regular integers
value11 = 42         ; Should be highlighted as decimal number
value12 = 100        ; Should be highlighted as decimal number
```

## All supported real number formats:
- `3e+4` - Scientific notation (integer + exponent)
- `3.14e+2` - Scientific notation (decimal + exponent)  
- `3.14` - Regular decimal number
- `.5` - Decimal starting with dot
