# Scripting Overview

The Klive IDE offers a simple but powerful way to automate tasks with a scripting facility. When you create a new Klive project (or open a folder containing a project), you can create script files with the `.ksx` file extension.

## `.ksx` Files

When you add a new `.ksx` file to your project, the code editor recognizes that and creates a source file using the scripting language. This example shows an empty scripting file:

When you create a simple script, two icons appear in the document tab bar:

<ClickableImage src="/images/scripting/script-with-icons.png" width={780} />

The first icon executes the script, the second one starts a new Klive instance and starts script execution in debug mode (so that you can debug your script with breakpoints).

When running the script, Klive displays a notification bar at the top of the code editor window:

## The Output Pane

As the script executes, it may display output, including information, errors, and warnings. All of these are displayed in a dedicated Output Pane below the code editor. The script execution keeps track of its output, so that you can see information from any script execution.

If you use the `$log()` API in your script, you can output information to the Output Pane:

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
You can clear the content of the Output Pane with `Ctrl+L`.
</Callout>

## Execution Progress

Sometimes, you may run a script that takes a long time to complete. Your script can display progress information with a progress bar and a descriptive text. Use the `$progress()` function:

<ClickableImage src="/images/scripting/script-output-progress.png" width={795} />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
If your script takes too long to complete or enters an infinite loop, the UI hangs too. Be mindful of your script's execution time and handle errors appropriately.
</Callout>

## Scripting History

The Klive IDE automatically keeps track of the scripts you have executed. The latest 50 scripts are displayed in the Scripting History panel. To see it, select the **View | Show Scripting History** menu command:

<ClickableImage src="/images/scripting/scripting-history.png" width={304} />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
When you move your mouse over a script file name in the history, a tooltip shows you the entire path to that file.
</Callout>

You can click any item in the history to run that script again.
