# Test Block Comments

Testing block comment styling:

```z80-assembly
; This is a line comment

// This is also a line comment

/** This is a documentation block comment **/

/* This is a regular block comment */

/* block content should use identifier color */
/* 
  multi-line block comment
  with identifier colored content
*/

/* Another example with text inside */

ld a, b  ; regular instruction
```
