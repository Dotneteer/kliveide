# Directives

The directives of the **Klive** Z80 Assembler representation are used for preprocessing, similarly to those in the C and C++ programming languages, though their semantics are different.
> Although you can add comments to the end of directives, they may not have labels.

## The #IF Directive

You can use this directive for conditional compilation. The argument of the directive is a
conditional expression, and it determines on which branch the compilation goes on. __#IF__
works in concert with `#ELSE` and `#ENDIF`:

```z80-klive
; Block #1
#if 2 > 3
    ld a,b
#endif

; Block #2;
#if 2 < 3
    nop
#else
    ld b,c
#endif

; Block #3
#if $ > $+2
    nop
#else
    ld b,c
#endif
```

Here, since the condition is false, **Block #1** does not generate output. **Block #2** emits a `nop`, as the condition is true. The false condition value in **Block #3** moves code parsing to the `#else` branch, emitting a `ld b,c` instruction.

## The #IFDEF and #IFNDEF Directives

These directives work similarly to #IF. However, they check if a particular symbol has (`#IFDEF`) or has not (`#IFNDEF`) been defined. So, their single argument is an identifier name.

## The #IFMOD and #IFNMOD Directives

These directives work similarly to `#IF`. However, these check if the code's current model is specified with the identifier following the `IFMOD` or `IFNMOD` pragma. Here is a short sample of using this directive:

```z80-klive
    .model Spectrum48

#ifmod Spectrum128
    BorderColor: .equ 5
    RetAddr: .equ #2604
#else
    BorderColor: .equ 4
    RetAddr: .equ #12a2
#endif

Start:
	.org #8000
    ld a,BorderColor
    out (#fe),a
    jp RetAddr
```

You can use only these identifiers with this pragma (case-insensitively): `SPECTRUM48`, 
`SPECTRUM128`, `SPECTRUMP3`, `NEXT`.

## The #DEFINE and #UNDEF Directives

You can explicitly define a symbol with the `#DEFINE` directive. Such a symbol has no concrete value, just its existence. With `#UNDEF`, you may declare a symbol undefined.

```z80-klive
#define SYMB

; Block #1
#ifdef SYMB
    ld a,b
#endif

#undef SYMB

; Block #2;
#ifdef SYMB
    nop
#else
    ld b,c
#endif
```

According to this definition, the first block emits a `ld, a,b` instruction, and the second one emits a `ld b,c` instruction.

## The #INCLUDE Directive

You can use this directive to load and process a source file from within another source file.

`#INCLUDE` accepts a string that names a file with its extension. The file name may contain either an absolute or a relative path. When a relative path is provided, its starting point is always the source file with the `#INCLUDE` directive.

Assume that this code is in the `C:\Work` folder:

```z80-klive
#include "Symbol.z80asm"
#include "./MyRules.z80asm"
#include "/Common/scroll.z80asm"
```

The compiler will check the `C:\Work` folder for the first two include files and `C:\Work\Commmon` for the third one.
