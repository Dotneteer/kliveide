# Command Reference

## `hide-disassembly`

Use this command to hide the machine code disassembly view.

```
hide-disassembly
```

## `hide-memory`

Use this command to hide the memory contents view.

```
hide-memory
```

## `outp`

You can select a particular output pane with this command.

```
outp <paneId>
```

The `paneId` argument can be one of the available output panes (`emu`, `build`, or `script`).

## `script-cancel`

This command runs the script file specified in the argument.

```
script-cancel <script-file-path-or-script-id>
```

Available aliases: `sc`

You can provide a script file name or a script ID as an argument. When you start a script, the ID of the running script is displayed. You can also get a particular script's ID from the Script History panel.

When you specify a file name, use the full name (including the `.ksx` file extension) relative to the project's root folder. For example, if your script is in the `scripts` folder and named `myScript.ksx`, use the `scripts/myScript.ksx` parameter.

## `script-run`

This command runs the script file specified in the argument.

```
script-run <script-file-path>
```

Available aliases: `sr`

Provide the full file name (including the `.ksx` file extension) relative to the project's root folder. For example, if your script is in the `scripts` folder and named `myScript.ksx`, use the `scripts/myScript.ksx` parameter.

## `set`

You can use this comment to set or delete a particular Klive setting.


```
set [-p] [-u] <key> [<value>] 
```

Use the `-p` option to set a project setting or `-u` for a user setting. `<key>` is the setting key, `<value>` is the new setting value. The specified key is removed if you omit `<value>`.

> **Note**: Project settings are saved in the currently open project file, while user settings are saved in the `Klive/live.settings` file under your user folder.

If you do not specify the context (with `-p` or `-u`), the IDE will save a project setting, provided a project is open; otherwise, it saves a user-level setting.

## `setl`

This command lists the specified settings.

```
setl [-p] [-u] [<setting>] 
```

Use the `-p` option to list project settings or `-u` for user settings. By default, all settings in the specified bucket are listed. Additionally, you can specify a setting prefix in `<setting>`. In this case, only matching settings are listed.

> **Note**: Project settings are saved in the currently open project file, while user settings are saved in the `Klive/live.settings` file under your user folder.

If you do not specify the context (with `-p` or `-u`), the IDE will list project settings, provided a project is open; otherwise, it lists user-level settings.

## `setm`

This command lists the specified settings.

```
setl [-pull] [-push] [-c] 
```

This command moves settings from the user setting file to the current project file (`-pull`) or vice versa (`push`). The additional `-c` option copies the settings instead of moving them.

> **Note**: You can use either `-pull` or `push`. This command works only when a Klive project is open in the IDE. 

## `show-disassembly`

Use this command to display the machine code disassembly view.

```
show-disassembly
```

## `show-memory`

Use this command to display the memory contents view.

```
show-memory
```

## `zxb-reset`

Use this command to set ZXBASIC integration.

```
zxb-reset <Full ZXBC executable path> [<python3 path>] [<start of machine code>]
```

Available aliases: `zxbr`

Provide the full executable path of the ZXBC compiler. Optionally, you can provide the path to the Python3 executable and the start of the machine code. See the [ZXBASIC integration](/working-with-ide/zxb) article for more information.
