# Installing Klive

Visit the project [release page](https://github.com/Dotneteer/kliveide/releases) to get the install kits for Klive. You find the latest release at the top of the page. When you expand the Assets tab, it will list five files, including the three installation kits:

- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}-{arch}.AppImage`: The Linux AppImage format to install Klive IDE on Linux without requiring an admin privilege to run
- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}-{arch}.exe`: Self-extracting executable to install Klive IDE on Windows x64 (NSIS installer)
- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}-{arch}.msi`: Windows Installer package for Klive IDE on Windows x64 (MSI installer)
- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}-{arch}.pkg`: The standard PKG format to install Klive IDE on MacOS

`{version}` is a placeholder for the version number of a particular release in the filename.
`{arch}` is a placeholder for the architecture of the target platform. It can be `x64` or `arm64`.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
Windows currently supports only the x64 architecture.
</Callout>

Download the file according to the operating system and architecture to use, and follow the sections of this article.

## MacOS Installation

Open the downloaded `.pkg` file. As the file comes from an untrusted source, the OS cannot install it directly. Click the OK button to close the message.

Now, open the System Settings panel and navigate the Privacy & Security tab. As you scroll down, you can see the message with the blocked filename and the Open Anyway button. Click the button to sign that you intend to run the install kit.

<ClickableImage src="/images/getting-started/privacy-and-security.png" alt="PrivacyAndSecurity" width={477} height={398} />

Open the `.pkg` file again and select the Open button in the security dialog on the screen.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
The OS may ask for your password to confirm the installation.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
The installer will create a Klive IDE folder in the Applications folder and copy the required files into it. It will also create a shortcut in the Launchpad. When you complete the installation, MacOS may ask you for access to your Downloads folder to recycle the install set optionally.
</Callout>

After the successful installation, you can find Klive IDE in your Applications folder.

## Windows Installation

Klive IDE provides two installer formats for Windows:

### NSIS Installer (.exe) - Recommended for most users

The `.exe` setup file is a self-extracting executable. Open it, and it will automatically extract itself and copy the executable files into the Programs (within your user home's `AppData/Local/Programs/klive-ide`) directory.

This installer typically provides a streamlined installation experience for individual users.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
**Known Issue on Windows 11**: Some users have reported that the NSIS installer may appear to hang or take an exceptionally long time to complete (10-22 minutes) on Windows 11 systems. If you experience this issue, the installer will eventually complete if you wait, or you can try the MSI installer as an alternative.
</Callout>

### MSI Installer (.msi) - Alternative installation method

The `.msi` setup file uses the Windows Installer framework. Double-click the file to start the installation process. Use this installer if:

- The NSIS (.exe) installer hangs or takes too long on your system
- You prefer using the Windows Installer framework
- You need transaction logging and rollback capabilities

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
The MSI installer may display "Please wait while Windows configures Klive IDE" for several minutes before showing progress. This is normal behavior due to Windows Installer overhead, especially on systems with real-time antivirus protection enabled. The installation will complete successfully if you wait.
</Callout>

Both installers will install Klive IDE to the same location and provide identical functionality. Choose the format that best fits your installation requirements.

The setup kit will start Klive IDE after completion. Later, you can start Klive IDE again:

Use the search in the Windows taskbar and type "Klive". The newly installed app shows up in the search results:

Click on Klive IDE to start it.

<Callout type="info" emoji="💡">
When Klive IDE is selected in the search result list, the right pane shows the Pin to taskbar command. Use this to add the IDE to the taskbar; later, you can run it with a single click on the Klive IDE icon.
</Callout>

## Linux Installation

The Linux install kit is an `.AppImage` file. You may need to download and install FUSE on your machine to use it. For example, on Ubuntu (where FUSE is not installed by default), you can install it:

```text
sudo apt-get install fuse libfuse2
```

Copy the `.AppImage` file into the folder from which you intend to use it. Make it executable with this command line:

```text
chmod +x KliveIdeSetup-{version}-{arch}.AppImage
```

Alternatively, you can right-click on the file in the file manager and select the Properties command. In the Permissions tab, check the Allow executing file as program checkbox:
