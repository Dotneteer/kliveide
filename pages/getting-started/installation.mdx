# Installing Klive

Visit the project [release page](https://github.com/Dotneteer/kliveide/releases) to get the install kits for Klive. You find the latest release at the top of the page. When you expand the Assets tab, it will list five files, including the three installation kits:

- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}.AppImage`: The Linux AppImage format to install Klive IDE on Linux without requiring an admin privilege to run
 - `KliveIdeSetup-{version}.exe`: Self-extracting executable to install Klive IDE on Windows x64
- `KliveIdeSetup-{version}.pkg`: The standard PKG format to install Klive IDE on MacOS

`{version}` is a placeholder for the version number of a particular release in the filename.

Download the file according to the operating system to use, and follow the sections of this article.

> **Note**: Though there is an install kit for Linux, I have yet to test it thoroughly. If you plan to work with Klive IDE on Linux, please help me test it or even create additional install kits. 

## MacOS Installation

Open the downloaded `.pkg` file. As the file comes from an untrusted source, the OS cannot install it directly. Click the OK button to close the message.

Now, open the System Settings panel and navigate the Privacy & Security tab. As you scroll down, you can see the message with the blocked filename and the Open Anyway button. Click the button to sign that you intend to run the install kit.

Open the `.pkg` file again and select the Open button in the security dialog on the screen.

> **Note**: The OS may ask for your password to confirm the installation.

Click Open to allow the installer to run. Follow the screenshots (use Continue) to complete the installation.

<Image src="/images/getting-started/install-step-4.png" alt="P&S" width="413" height="296" style={{marginTop: 24}} />

> **Note**: The installer will create a Klive IDE folder in the Applications folder and copy the required files into it. It will also create a shortcut in the Launchpad. When you complete the installation, MacOS may ask you for access to your Downloads folder to recycle the install set optionally.

After the successful installation, you can find Klive IDE in your Applications folder.

## Windows Installation

The setup file is a self-extracting executable. Open it, and it will automatically extract itself and copy the executable files into the Programs (within your user home's`AppData/Local/Programs/klive-ide`) directory.

The setup kit will start Klive IDE after completion. Later, you can start Klive IDE again:

Use the search in the Windows taskbar and type "Klive". The newly installed app shows up in the search results:

Click on Klive IDE to start it.

> **Note**: When Klive IDE is selected in the search result list, the right pane shows the Pin to taskbar command. Use this to add the IDE to the taskbar; later, you can run it with a single click on the Klive IDE icon.

## Linux Installation

*I have not tried to install Klive IDE on Linux. If you did and have a helpful description of the installation steps, please create a PR to extend the installation notes in this article.*
