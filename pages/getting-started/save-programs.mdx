# Saving Files

When you issue a `SAVE` operation that targets the tape (with ZX Spectrum +3E, you can save the code to disks), Klive saves the code into a `.tzx` file. Klive saves these files into the `Klive/SavedFiles` folder within your home directory.

> **Note**: As of now, you cannot change this default location. However, in the future, Klive will have a setting to define another folder for saved files according to your preference.

You can move the saved files to any other location. Using the **Machine | Set Tape File** command, you can mount that file to load later.
