# Saving Files

When you issue a `SAVE` operation that targets the tape (with ZX Spectrum +3E, you can save the code to disks), Klive saves the code into a `.tzx` file.

- If a Klive project is open in the IDE, the file goes into the `SavedFiles` folder within the open project folder. The Explorer refreshes its view accordingly.
- Otherwise, Klive saves these files into your home directory's `Klive/SavedFiles` folder.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
As of now, you cannot change this default location. However, in the future, Klive will have a setting to define another folder for saved files according to your preference.
</Callout>

You can move the saved files to any other location. Using the **Machine | Set Tape File** command, you can mount that file to load later.
