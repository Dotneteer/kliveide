# Binary Literal Test

Testing various binary number formats:

```z80-klive
; Percent prefix binary literals (Z80 style)
%01011111        ; Should be highlighted as binary
%10101010        ; Should be highlighted as binary  
%1111_0000       ; Should be highlighted as binary (with underscores)
%_1010_1010_     ; Should be highlighted as binary (leading/trailing underscores)

; C-style binary literals (0b prefix)
0b01011111       ; Should be highlighted as binary
0b10101010       ; Should be highlighted as binary
0b1111_0000      ; Should be highlighted as binary (with underscores)
0b_1010_1010_    ; Should be highlighted as binary (leading/trailing underscores)

; Suffix-style binary literals
01011111b        ; Should be highlighted as binary
10101010B        ; Should be highlighted as binary (uppercase)
1111_0000b       ; Should be highlighted as binary (with underscores)

; Mixed with other tokens
ld a, %11111111  ; Z80 instruction + binary literal
.db %01010101    ; pragma + binary literal
value = 0b1100   ; assignment with binary
```

## All supported binary formats:
- `%01011111` - Percent prefix (Z80 style)
- `0b01011111` - C-style prefix
- `01011111b` - Suffix style (lowercase)
- `01011111B` - Suffix style (uppercase)
- All formats support underscores for readability
