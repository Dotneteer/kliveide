# IDE Startup Options

Klive displays two separate windows, the **Klive Retro-Computer Emulator** window, and **Klive IDE**. This arrangement allows you to use Klive in a multi-monitor environment.

When you start Klive the first time after installation, only the emulator window appears. You can display the IDE window with the **View | Show IDE** menu command. When you close Klive, it saves the arrangements of these windows and restores them when you open the program next time.

Also, by default, Klive IDE loads the last project you opened when it starts (provided you used a project in the last session). To turn off this feature, toggle the **IDE | IDE Settings | Open the last project at startup** option.

When you load a project, Klive IDE automatically opens its build root file. You can turn off this feature by toggling the **IDE | IDE Settings | Open the build root of the project** option.
