# Diagnostics

Klive allows you to turn on and off the console log of the Emulator and IDE windows. This log may contain information to help troubleshoot issues with Klive and fix bugs.

Use these steps to turn on the console log:

1. Start Klive
2. In the IDE window, execute this command:

```text
set -u devTools.allow 1
```
3. Restart Klive 

After these changes, you can use the **View | Toggle Developer Tools** menu command to display or hide the developer tools (similar to Chrome). The **Console** tab displays the diagnostics messages, including warnings and errors.

You can turn off the console log by executing this command in the IDE window:

```text
set -u devTools.allow 0
```

You should restart Klive after changing the setting.
