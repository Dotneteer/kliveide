# Measuring T-States

Klive makes measuring the number of T-states (clock cycles) a current piece of code consumes easy. When you open the [CPU panel](../working-with-ide/cpu), it displays a value, **TSP**, which stands for *T-states elapsed since the last pause*. Whenever your paused machine continues the code execution (debugging), the next time it gets paused, this value displays the number of T-states used since the last pause.

## Example

Take a look at the following code (use the ZX Spectrum 48K model):

```z80klive
Start:
    .model Spectrum48
    .org #8000
    ld a,2;	      ; (START)
    call #1601    ; open the channel
    ld hl,Message ; HL points the the message string
NextCh:
    ld a,(hl)     ; get next character
    or a
    jr z,Done     ; we reached the end
    rst #10       ; display character
    inc hl        ; next character
    jr NextCh     ; next loop
Done:
    jp #12a9      ; (END)


Message:
    .dm "\a\x0A\x06" ; AT 10, 6
    .dm "\p\x04"     ; PAPER 4
    .dm "Welcome to Klive IDE"
    .dm "\a\x0B\x08" ; AT 10, 8
    .dm "\p\x04"     ; PAPER 4
    .dm "\b\x01"     ; BRIGH 1
    .dm "(ZX Spectrum 48)"
    .db 0x00         ; terminate
```

Add two breakpoints to the lines marked with **(START)** and **(END)**. Now, run the code in the debugger. When the code execution stops at the first breakpoint, **(START)**, check **TSP** at the CPU panel:

<ClickableImage src="/images/howto/tstate-1.png" width="256" />

Click continue and let your code access the second breakpoint, **(END)**. The **TSP** value shows the number of T-states that have elapsed since continuing from **(START)**:

<ClickableImage src="/images/howto/tstate-2.png" width="256" />

<Callout type="info" emoji="ðŸ’¡">
Now you can see how many T-states your code consumes between two breakpoints. This feature is handy when you want to optimize your code for speed.
</Callout>

## Conditions Influencing T-States

There are some things you should consider when measuring the number of T-States:

**1. Memory contention**

The ZX Spectrum 48K model's CPU and ULA contend for memory access to the $4000-$7fff address range when reading or writing information. The ULA may block the CPU for a few states. So, when your code runs, it may display a bit different **TSP** values for each run due to memory contention.

**2. Interrupts**

If your code takes more than 20 milliseconds to run, an interrupt request is likely. In this case, the interrupt handler's T-states are also summed up to the **TSP** value.
