# Test Decimal Number Fix

Testing decimal numbers that start with a dot:

```z80-assembly
; These should be recognized as numbers:
.25
.5 
.123
.0
.999

; These should still be identifiers:
.org
.label
.myvar

; Mixed examples:
ld a, .25     ; .25 should be a number
call .mylabel ; .mylabel should be an identifier
```
