# 6510 CPU Implementation Analysis

This document provides an analysis of the M6510Cpu implementation in the Klive IDE project, documenting its architecture, approaches, strengths, and potential areas for improvement.

## Implementation Overview

The 6510 CPU is implemented in a single TypeScript file (`M6510Cpu.ts`) that provides a comprehensive emulation of the MOS 6510 processor, including official and undocumented instructions. The implementation follows a cycle-accurate approach, allowing for precise timing emulation.

## Key Implementation Aspects

### Architecture

- **Class Structure**: The CPU is implemented as a class (`M6510Cpu`) that implements the `IM6510Cpu` interface
- **Operation Table**: Uses a function table approach where each opcode maps to a specific operation function
- **Memory Interface**: Abstracts memory access through `readMemory`/`writeMemory` methods with separate implementation methods (`doReadMemory`/`doWriteMemory`)
- **Cycle Timing**: Properly accounts for CPU cycles with methods to increment tacts and handle timing

### CPU State Management

- **Registers**: All 6510 registers are properly implemented (A, X, Y, P, PC, SP)
- **Flags**: Status register (P) flags are managed through helper methods
- **Interrupts**: Support for NMI and IRQ handling with proper flag checking
- **Stalling**: Support for CPU stalling, useful for implementing cycle stealing (such as VIC-II "bad lines")

### Instruction Support

- **Complete Instruction Set**: All 151 official opcodes are implemented
- **Undocumented Instructions**: Comprehensive implementation of undocumented instructions including:
  - SLO (Shift Left and OR)
  - RLA (Rotate Left and AND)
  - SRE (Shift Right and EOR)
  - RRA (Rotate Right and Add)
  - LAX (Load A and X)
  - SAX (Store A AND X)
  - DCP (Decrement and Compare)
  - ISC (Increment and Subtract)
  - And other rare undocumented operations (AAC, ARR, ATX, AXA, etc.)
- **CPU Jamming**: Properly implements the CPU jam state that occurs with certain undocumented opcodes

### Memory and I/O

- **Memory Access**: Clean separation between CPU logic and memory system
- **I/O Handling**: Tracks I/O operations for debugging purposes
- **Port Handling**: Support for the 6510-specific I/O port at addresses $0000-$0001

### Testing

- **Comprehensive Tests**: Extensive test suite covering all instructions
- **Undocumented Behavior**: Dedicated tests for undocumented instructions
- **Edge Cases**: Tests for flag behavior, timing, and special case handling

## Implementation Strengths

1. **Cycle Accuracy**: The implementation properly accounts for the cycle timing of all instructions
2. **Complete Instruction Coverage**: Includes all official and undocumented instructions
3. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between CPU logic and system integration
4. **Robust Testing**: Thorough testing ensures correct operation
5. **Debugging Support**: Extensive debugging capabilities through state tracking

## Noteworthy Implementation Details

### CPU Stalling

The implementation includes a mechanism for stalling the CPU, which is essential for emulating the VIC-II "bad line" behavior where the CPU is paused for VIC-II memory access. This is handled through a `_stalled` counter and methods to stall and release the CPU.

```typescript
stallCpu(): void {
  this._stalled = 1;
}

releaseCpu(): void {
  this._stalled = 0;
}

waitForCpuRelease(): void {
  while (this._stalled) {
    // --- Wait until the CPU is released
    this.incrementTacts(); // Increment tacts to avoid infinite loop
    this._stalled++;
    if (this._stalled > 1000) {
      console.warn("CPU stalled for too long, releasing...");
      this.releaseCpu();
    }
  }
}
```

This includes a safety mechanism to prevent infinite stalling, which is a good practice.

### Undocumented Instructions

The implementation fully supports undocumented 6510 instructions, which is essential for compatibility with software that relies on these behaviors. For example, the SLO instruction:

```typescript
/**
 * SLO is an undocumented instruction that performs two operations in sequence:
 * 1. ASL (Arithmetic Shift Left) on the memory location
 * 2. ORA (Logical OR) between the accumulator and the shifted memory value
 */
```

### Memory Access

The memory access implementation provides a clean separation between CPU logic and the actual memory system, allowing for different memory models to be used with the same CPU core:

```typescript
readMemory(address: number): number {
  this.delayMemoryRead(address);
  this.lastMemoryReads.push(address);
  const value = (this.lastMemoryReadValue = this.doReadMemory(address));
  return value;
}

doReadMemory(_address: number): number {
  return 0xff;
}
```

### Execution Flow

The CPU cycle execution is implemented with clear handling of interrupts and normal instruction execution:

```typescript
executeCpuCycle(): void {
  if (this._jammed) {
    return;
  }
  if (this._nmiRequested) {
    this.handleNmi();
    this._nmiRequested = false;
  } else if (this._irqRequested && !this.isIFlagSet()) {
    this.handleIrq();
    this._irqRequested = false;
  } else {
    // --- Handle regular CPU cycle
    const opCode = this.readMemory(this._pc);
    this._pc = (this._pc + 1) & 0xFFFF; // Properly wrap PC to 16 bits
    this.opCode = opCode; // Store the current opcode
    this.operationTable[opCode](this);
  }
}
```

## Observations and Potential Improvements

1. **TODO Comments**: There appear to be some "TODO" comments in the implementation for NMI and IRQ handling. These should be implemented for complete functionality.

2. **Large File Size**: The implementation is in a single file that is quite large (8880 lines). Consider breaking this into multiple files for better maintainability.

3. **Safety in Cycle Handling**: The stalling mechanism has a built-in safety to prevent infinite loops, but it might be worth considering a more deterministic approach.

## Testing Approach

The testing approach is thorough and focuses on:

1. **Individual Instructions**: Each instruction is tested separately
2. **Undocumented Behavior**: Specific tests for undocumented instructions
3. **Edge Cases**: Tests for behavior at boundary conditions
4. **Flag Behavior**: Verification of correct flag setting
5. **Timing**: Validation of cycle timing

## Conclusion

The 6510 CPU implementation in the Klive IDE project is comprehensive, well-structured, and appears to accurately emulate the behavior of the real hardware. The inclusion of undocumented instructions and cycle-accurate timing makes it suitable for accurate C64 emulation. The thorough testing approach provides confidence in the implementation's correctness.

The clean separation between CPU logic and system integration allows for flexibility in how the CPU is integrated into the larger C64 emulation system, particularly for handling the complex interactions with the VIC-II and memory system.
