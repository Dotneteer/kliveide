In this article, you will learn how to build and run a small program written with Z80 assembly. Follow these steps:
1. Start Klive, and select the **File \| New project** menu function.
2. The IDE window appears and pops up the New Project dialog.
3. Leave the machine type ZX Spectrum 48, and set the Project name to **myFirstZ80**.
4. When you click OK, the IDE creates the new project and opens it in the Explorer panel.

Klive creates a new project with sample code. With a few clicks, you can build and run it:

Expand the code folder in the explorer to reveal its content. As the figure shows, the folder has two files; each is decorated with a small icon to the right of the file name:

Expand the code folder in the explorer to reveal its content. As the figure shows, the folder has two files; each is decorated with a small icon to the right of the file name:

![Z80 code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tutorials/z80-project-editor.png)

The icon indicates that these files are marked as *build roots*, namely files that the Klive IDE can compile, inject into the machine, and run.
Click the `code.kz80.asm` file; the IDE opens it in the code editor. In the top-right area of the tab bar, you can see four little icons. These are command icons to work with the code file in the editor; from left to right: **Compile**, **Inject code**, **Run program**, and **Debug program**.

Click the third icon (play symbol); it activates the **Run program** command. This action compiles the code, injects it into the virtual machine, and starts it. The IDE displays the compiler message in the output window pane:

When you switch to the emulator window, you can see the result of the sample Z80 assembly code:

When you click a key (for example, Enter), the emulator clears the screen and displays the cursor.

> *Note*: Waiting for a key is not part of the code you have just run. The code terminates with the `jp #12a9` statement that conveys the control to the main execution cycle of ZX Spectrum 48, which waits for a key.
