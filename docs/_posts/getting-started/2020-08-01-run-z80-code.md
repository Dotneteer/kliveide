Klive allows you to create Z80 Assembly files and run the corresponding code in the Klive Emulator. In this short tutorial, you will learn how easy it to do that.

> Note: When you create a Klive project, the IDE creates a sample `code.z80asm` file in the `code` folder. Klive IDE uses the `.z80asm` file extension for its Z80 Assembly files, as the traditional `.asm` file extension might be overwritten by other VS Code extensions.

## Running Your First Z80 Assembly Code from Klive IDE

Follow these steps:

1. Open or create a Klive IDE project (see details [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/create-klive-project.html#article)).
2. Ensure the the Klive Emulator runs. You can start it by clicking the Klive area in VS Code's statusbar:
