Klive allows you to create Z80 Assembly files and run the corresponding code in the Klive Emulator. In this short tutorial, you will learn how easy it to do that.

> Note: When you create a Klive project, the IDE creates a sample `code.z80asm` file in the `code` folder. Klive IDE uses the `.z80asm` file extension for its Z80 Assembly files, as other VS Code extensions might overwrite the traditional `.asm` file extension.

## Running Your First Z80 Assembly Code from Klive IDE

Follow these steps:

1. Open or create a Klive IDE project (see details [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/getting-started/create-klive-project.html#article)).
2. Ensure the Klive Emulator runs. You can start it by clicking the Klive area in VS Code's status bar:

![Disconnected state]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tutorials/klive-disconnected.png)

{:start="3"}
3. Click the `code.z80asm` file in the `code` folder to open it in the code editor.
4. Click the **Run Program** icon in the navigation bar of the code editor:

![Z80 code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tutorials/z80-code-in-editor.png)

{:start="5"}
5. Klive IDE compiles the code and then runs it in the emulator:

![Z80 code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tutorials/z80-code-runs.png)

{:start="6"}
6. Click the emulator screen to let it get the keyboard focus.
7. As you click any key recognized by the emulator as a ZX Spectrum key (for example, Enter), the virtual machine clears the screen and enters the main execution loop of the ZX Spectrum:

In the **Output** pane, you can check the **Klive Compiler** messages:

## How It Works

The Klive Z80 Assembler (it is in the VS Code Extension for Klive IDE) compiles the source code into Z80 machine code:

```
; Sample code
  .injectopt subroutine
Start:
  .model Spectrum48
  .org #8000
  ld a,2;	    ; upper screen
  call #1601    ; open the channel
  ld hl,Message ; HL points the the message string
NextCh:
  ld a,(hl)     ; get next character
  or a
  ret z         ; jump back to main cycle when terminated
  rst #10       ; display character
  inc hl        ; next character
  jr NextCh     ; next loop

Message:
  .dm "\a\x0A\x05" ; AT 10, 5
  .dm "\b\x01"     ; BRIGHT 1
  .dm "\i\x01"     ; INK 1
  .dm "Hello, from Klive IDE!"
  .dm "\a\x0B\x05" ; AT 11, 5
  .dm "\b\x01"     ; BRIGHT 1
  .dm "\i\x02"     ; INK 2
  .dm "   (Z80 Assembler)    "
  .db 0x00         ; terminate
```

This code is simple; you can quickly understand it with the comments. Nonetheless, there are a few peculiarities of this code:

1. The `.injectopt subroutine` pragma instructs the IDE that the code can be executed by calling it as a subroutine that returns with a `RET` Z80 instruction. (Otherwise, the code would finish its operation with a `JP` instruction, for example, with `jp #12ac` to enter into the ZX Spectrum 48K's main execution cycle).
2. The `.model Spectrum48` pragma tells the IDE that whatever ZX Spectrum machine this project uses, the code should run in ZX Spectrum 48 mode.

When the Z80 Assembler successfully compiled the code, it carries out the injection process:

1. It stops the running machine.
2. It starts the machine and waits while it reaches the main execution cycle of that machine.
3. It pauses the machine and injects the machine code into the memory.
4. It calls the code as a subroutine, provided `.injectopt subroutine` is used; otherwise, it jumps to the code's entry point.
5. When the subroutine ends, the code returns to the current machine's main execution cycle. For example, it is `$12ac` for a ZX Spectrum 48K.

## Other Options to Run the Code

The code editor's navigation bar contains a few other commands that are related to code execution:

![Z80 code]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/tutorials/code-related-commands.png)

1. The **Compile** command runs the comiler to check that your code is free from errors.
2. The **Inject Code** command injects the code into the memory of the machine while that is paused. After resuming, you can invoke the injected code.
3. The **Debug Program** command starts the program in debug mode. *This command is not implemented yet.*
4. The **Run Program** start the code in normal mode (without debugging).
5. You can export the successfully compiled code into a tape file. *This command is not implemented yet.*
